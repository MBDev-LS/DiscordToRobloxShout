# Discord Slash Command to Roblox Group Shout

## What is this?
This is discord bot that I threw together in an hour, it allows the user to post a 'shout' to a Roblox group via a Discord slash command.

I've tried to tidy it up a bit and allow for easy use an modification.

## Can I use it?
Yep, you can, for more info see [licence.txt](licence.txt).

## Where do I start?
If you know your way around Discord.py<span> you'll probably have no issue diving straight in, it does use an extention but really isn't that complex. Having said that, I've linked all relivent documentation below.
